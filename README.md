# Devass
Developer smart assistant

## Motivation
As a developer, I always downloaded new servers, IDEs, package managers, global packages, and development tools, day after another, my development machine became scattered between different folders, workspaces, and partitions, and many of them became out dated, our machine is almost like the missy desktop “natural” people have at the end of each month :D 

I hope that I can find a software to organize my development machine, while I did not find one, I open this open source project to start building one, and hope to find contributers to work with me on the project.

## Headlines
* Lister: devass will scan your machine and give you centralized place to list:
  * All development related installer.
  * All installed servers and there status.
  * All package managers and global packages.
  * All ides and workspaces.
  
* Projects Dashboard: list all of your project including language detection, framework detection, used versioning system, the remote origin of the project. the module can give you an overview about your development experiance, and I think it will amazed you with some unexpected results!

* Assistant: it's not enough to have a centralized place for all of that, Devass most help us keep our project and environment clean and up-to-date, and give us hint and suggestion about:
  * Available updates for development tools.
  * Available updates for the frameworks and packages used in every single proejct.
  * Quick fixes for common issues like "set windows environment variables".
  * Suggest to create a git repo for not versioned projects.
  * Notify you if a git project is not up-to-date with remote origin, or have a "big" uncommited changes!
